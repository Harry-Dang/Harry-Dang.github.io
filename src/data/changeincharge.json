    "paragraph": "As two robotic siblings roam a hazardous magnetic landscape in search of their parents, the impatient younger sibling constantly runs ahead, eager to continue the search. In this puzzle platformer, help the siblings get back together by manipulating the charge of the robots and eluding or exploiting magnetic charges in their surroundings. Explore different worlds and magnetic objects with each level to ultimately bring the two siblings together. The siblings can only reunite if they each have a different charge, so play strategically!",
